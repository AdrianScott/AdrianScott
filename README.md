## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adrian Scott

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Machine Learning, LLMs, A.I.-augmented coding tools, A.I. apps for creativity and community, see disttraintest for distributed training example and adamwtest for an experimental optimizer test
- I have a doctorate in Mathematics, which applied nonlinear optimization and Bayes Theorem to biology challenges
- This Github profile doesn't show most of the code that I do, which is decentralized across multiple profiles & providers (not just Github), or is private
- The heatmap isn't reflective of my volume or activity levels. In addition to coding across multiple profiles & providers, the heatmap doesn't show commits in projects I've forked & extended
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email: firstname at firstname lastname dot com
- âš¡ Fun fact: Besides tech stuff, I've sung w/ Placido Domingo, performed with the New York City Ballet and acted in several films, including a scene with Robert De Niro.
